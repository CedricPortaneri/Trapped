/***** Trapped *****/

This is a 3D horror game school project made by CÃ©dric Portaneri in October 2015 (in two weeks). 
At this time I was a 5th year computer science student from the engineering school Polytech Paris Sud and M2 interaction student of Paris Saclay.

This game was made for "3D sound" part of the virtual and augmented reality course from the M2 interaction.
I had to design a game from scratch using as a main gameplay component the 3D sound.
I choose to make a horror game where you have to find the exit door to win by following its music. Unfortunately a monster will try to kill you 
(you can hear its sound louder as it come next to you) and some landmines on the ground will explode if you stay next to them.

Kind of spooky.
